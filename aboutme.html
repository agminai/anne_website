			<h2>About Me</h2>	
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			 Hi, I'm Anne.
			<br>
			<br>
			I have a B.A. in Psychology from the University of British <br> Columbia, and 3 years of private tutoring experience in Canada. <br> I was born in Seattle, in the United States. I moved to Canada<br> when I was 19, and have travelled around Europe and Southeast Asia.<br> I have recently moved to Toulouse. I love teaching because I love<br> meeting new people, and seeing my students' enthusiasm and progress.<br> It also allows me to work and experience life in other countries, so I<br> can continue travelling!
			<br>
			<br>
			My background in both psychology and education allows me to plan<br> effective and enjoyable lessons for my students. I don't just teach out of<br> textbooks. I believe the most effective way to learn languages is through<br> conversation with native speakers, and to personalize each lesson to the<br> student's needs and goals.
			<br>
			<br>
			I also have personal experience learning another language. I studied French in school, and am now living in France to improve my language skills. This means I can relate to the challenges and benefits that come with language learning.

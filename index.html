				<ul>
	 				<li><b>Private English lessons with a native speaker</b> <br>
					Standard lessons are 50 minutes. Upon request, longer lessons may be available. 
					
					<br>
					<b>Des cours particuliers d’anglais avec une personne de langue maternelle anglaise</b>
					Les leçons standards durent 50 minutes. Sur demande, des leçons plus longues peuvent être disponibles.	
					</li>
					<br>
					<br>
		
					<li><b>Free 20 minute meeting</b> <br>
					Each new student can schedule a free, 20 minute meeting with me, the tutor. We will talk about your current level of English, your goals, and your interests. I will show you some examples of my lesson plans so you can decide whether you want to schedule a lesson with me. </li>
					<br>
					<br>
	
					<li><b>Personalized lesson plan</b> <br>
					The lessons will be based on each student's specific goals and areas they want extra help on. For example, the student can choose whether they want to focus on speaking, listening, reading or writing. Lessons can focus on conversation skills, professional language for English-speaking jobs, or basic English needed for travel. </li>
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<li><b>Learn practical, useful English</b> <br>
					Most lessons are taught in English. I will adjust my speed and vocabulary based on your 	
					level. Since I am a native speaker, you will hear how English is spoken in everyday life. I will focus on teaching you the most common and practical expressions, and help you speak English naturally and confidently!
					<br>
					<br>
					We will not learn every grammar rule or memorize long lists of vocabulary. Instead, we will focus on language skills that are most useful for the situations you will be in. </li>
	 				<br>
					<br>
	 				
					<li> <b>Engaging lessons</b> <br>
					I use fun and useful activities in my lesson plans, such as watching and discussing Ted Talks, magazine articles, or memes. I use English games like Taboo to build vocabulary and descriptive language skills.  </li>
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<li><b>Beginner lessons available in French</b> <br>
					If you are very new to learning English, you may request the first several lessons be taught in French. More English will be added as the student progresses. Please understand that I speak French, but it is not my native language. </li>
				</ul>
